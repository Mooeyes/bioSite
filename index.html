                <h2>Magnet Fishing</h2>
                <p>Magnet fishing is described as part environmentalism and treasure hunting with basics consisting of fishing with
                     a magnet and rope instead of poles and line.  A major part of the appeal with magnet fishing is cleaning and 
                     removing these foreign objects from varied bodies of water, but also finding truly interesting
                      bounties that were once lost.  The gear used in magnet fishing usually includes gloves, rope, magnet, 
                      and in some cases a grappling hook. Magnet fishing is a hobby that is rising in popularity in America 
                      but seems to be a well-established hobby with laws and permits in other parts of the world. Magnet fishing 
                      is considered by many to fall under the umbrella of waste pickers, mudlarking, scrap finders, treasure hunters etc. 
                      Magnet fishing bounties cover a wide range from miniscule paperclips to safes and even weapons. Some see magnet fishing, 
                      as a help to the environment while others believe it is more of a disturbance that could lead to more harmful risks. 
                      Regardless, this is a hobby rising in popularity and creating a growing community around the world.  </p>
