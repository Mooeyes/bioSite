        <h2>Discovery</h2>
         
        <p>During the pandemic, Wendy discovered magnet fishing though YouTube and her other interest, British Canal Narrowboating 
        and was hooked! The idea of being impactful to the environment in a positive way appealed to Wendy and she began to pursue 
        the hobby in earnest after six months of watching videos. Wendy purchased a kit on Amazon and went on her first trip. 
        One of the hardest parts of magnet fishing, besides the weather, is finding good, safe locations.

        <h2>Safety and Essentials</h2>
        <p>
            One of the hardest parts of magnet fishing, besides the weather, is finding good, safe locations.  
            Safety is very important as you may not know what you are pulling out of the water and you risk getting 
            cuts from any rusty items and the locations in which you are fishing.  A good magnet fishing kit 
            includes: magnet, strong rope, locking carabiners, grappling hooks, thread locker for eyebolts, 
            scrapers, puncture and water resistant gloves, and buckets for carrying gear and any finds.
