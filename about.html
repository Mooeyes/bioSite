<p>
    Wendy grew up in California, moved to Florida in 2001 when her husband transferred for work. 
    She homeschool her children after having a career in the tech manufacturing sector in the Silicon Valley. 
    Once her children were in college, she went back to work as a Volunteer Director for a non-profit. 
    Eventually, she desired part time work, and spent 5 fun years at Walt Disney World before being furloughed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Wendy hopes to magnet fish across the country once her husband retires.

    Through magnet fishing, Wendy has also discovered other interests she hopes to pursue or study in the future like mudlarking, exploring, and light dumpster diving.
